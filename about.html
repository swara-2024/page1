                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission at Swara is simple: we want every child to speak clearly and confidently. No matter where they live, we believe all kids should have the chance to express themselves well. That's why we offer our platform for free. Our goal is to help children in cities and villages alike improve their speech skills. We're here to support them as they grow, making sure they can communicate with ease.
                </p>
